## Recommended Material

**Book**

If there would be a book or resources I'd want share with you they are the following:
[Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/). You can find the [full PDF in their GH repo](https://github.com/janishar/mit-deep-learning-book-pdf/blob/master/complete-book-pdf/deeplearningbook.pdf). This is a very comprehensive book that is up to date and good to read with a valuable Bibliography.

**Courses**

MIT's [6.S191](http://introtodeeplearning.com/): Introduction to Deep Learning is a good course covering also Reinforcment Learning and GANs.
Stanford's [CS231n](https://cs231n.github.io/) is a good place to dive deeper into the mechanics of computer vision.

**Other Materials**

The (IMO) didactically best material on deep learning is [Google, Tensorflow and deep learning without a PhD series](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/tensorflow-without-a-phd), by [Martin GÃ¶rner](https://twitter.com/martin_gorner). 
The [official Tensorflow Resources](https://www.tensorflow.org/overview) are well done and helpful. There are a big number of examples, tutorials and other resources available. Also helpful is their [page on additional learning resources](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/learn-ml).
